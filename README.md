# Cyber-Toolbox
My personal cybersecurity toolbox with notes, guides, and real-world workflows.
This repository is not about theory — it’s about hands-on use, repeatable workflows, and understanding how tools behave in real environments.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Document how I actually use security tools in labs  
- Build repeatable investigation workflows  
- Track lessons learned while practicing detection & analysis  
- Create a quick-reference library for future projects  
- Show practical SOC/DFIR skill development  

---

## Who This Is For

- Entry-level SOC analysts learning tools  
- Students building home labs  
- Anyone wanting simple, practical tool references  
- My future self when I forget commands 😄

## Repository Structure

Each tool has its own guide that includes:

- What the tool is  
- What I use it for  
- Basic setup notes  
- Core concepts  
- Common workflows  
- Key commands  
- Troubleshooting tips  
- Lessons learned

## Philosophy

I focus on:

Tools are important — but mindset and analysis matter more.
